    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Quick Summary:</strong> Plantry is a 100% offline app. All your plant data stays on your device.
        We don't collect, upload, or share any of your information.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to Plantry ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle
        information when you use our mobile application ("App"). Your privacy is important to us,
        and we are committed to protecting it.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection - WE COLLECT ZERO DATA</h2>
    <p><strong style="color: #d32f2f; font-size: 18px;">Plantry collects ZERO user data. We do not collect, transmit, store, or process any of your information on our servers or any third-party servers.</strong></p>
    <p>Plantry is designed to work completely offline. The App stores the following data <strong>exclusively and only locally on your device</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plant Information:</strong> Names, strains, growing phases, and other plant-related data you enter</li>
        <li><strong>Grow Logs:</strong> Notes, measurements (pH, EC, temperature, humidity), watering schedules, and feeding data</li>
        <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Images you take or select from your device to document plant growth</li>
        <li><strong>Room & Equipment Data:</strong> Information about your grow rooms and hardware</li>
        <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> Your preferences such as language and theme (dark/light mode)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Store Your Data</h2>
    <p><strong>All data is stored locally on your device.</strong> We do NOT:</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do not share your data with anyone.</strong> Since all data is stored locally on your device
        and we have no servers, there is no way for us to access or share your information.

    </p>

        <li>Storing backup files in a secure location</li>
        <li>Not sharing your backup files with untrusted parties</li>
    </ul>

        and on this page. The "Last Updated" date at the top will indicate when changes were made.
    </p>
